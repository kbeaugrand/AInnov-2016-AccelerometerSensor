# AInnov-2016-AccelerometerSensor

This project is about connecting an accelerometer to a RasBerry PI3 Using Windows 10 IoT Core solution (In C#).
We could initialize this chip on an I2C bus and then read it's register values.

## MMA8451
This is a chipset from ADAFruit providing us the accelerometer sensor for the Project.
